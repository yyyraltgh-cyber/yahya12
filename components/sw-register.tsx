/**
 * Registers the PWA service worker — but ONLY for real web/browser
  * visits, never inside the Capacitor native Android app.
   *
    * Root cause of repeated "rebuilt and reinstalled but nothing changed"
     * reports: the app is fully bundled inside the APK already (it doesn't
      * need Cache Storage API to work offline), so the service worker served
       * no purpose here — it only added a second, independent caching layer
        * that could keep serving old CSS/JS after a fresh install, no matter
         * how many times the APK itself was rebuilt correctly. Capacitor injects
          * `window.Capacitor` at runtime, which is what we gate on below.
           *
            * This also actively unregisters and purges any service worker + cache
             * left over on a device from earlier testing (before this fix existed),
              * so devices already affected self-heal on the very next app launch —
               * no manual cache-clearing or uninstall ritual required going forward.
